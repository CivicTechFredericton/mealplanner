    "Tips": "Keep batter for fermentation in a container that has enough room to raise. Add little water while grinding. Adjust water depending on required batter consistency. Dosa batter should be of pouring consistency. Make sure it's neither too thick nor too watery. Millets must be soaked for a minimum of 6 hrs to make the grains more digestible."
